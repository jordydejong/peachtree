# explanation

I timeboxed my development at 8 hours. As such, I was not able to complete this faily large assignment completely, by finishing all the requirements and providing production ready code. I am not sure this gives a good indication of my capabilities regarding frontend softwarde development. However, I hope this gives some insights on my competences with the basics of Angular development, application state management, html/css and so forth.

Things I would have done, if I had spend more time on this assignment:

functional requirements:
- Preview data in separate window, before submit
- click "x" for clear filter
- remember previously selected sorting order

other:
- sorting / pagination / ordering in service instead of component (potentially in mocked backend calls)
- Much more tests / better test coverage. I have created only one small unit test (for the translation-list component). 
- end to end tests
- i18n
- a11y
- better form validation, probably by creating reactive forms instead of template driven
- better/cleaner html and css, making better use of variables / theming
- loading state ( in application state, and some graphical loader / overlay )
- better error handling
